STOP. Do NOT partially convert. Do NOT simplify. 
I need a 100% pixel-perfect, identical conversion of my React website into plain HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

⚠️ My previous conversion only finished ~50%. The hero image didn’t load, some sections disappeared, images and effects were missing. That failure MUST be corrected.

This time, follow these rules with ZERO exceptions:

====================================================
🎯 GOAL
Reproduce the React website EXACTLY as it appears visually. 
Not “similar”. Not “close”. Not “partial”.

✔ Same layout
✔ Same spacing
✔ Same animations
✔ Same images
✔ Same fonts
✔ Same effects
✔ Same content
✔ Same responsiveness
✔ Same sections (ALL of them)
====================================================

====================================================
📌 FULL PAGE CONVERSION (MANDATORY)
Every page must be fully converted:
- index.html (homepage)
- about.html
- pricing.html
- case-studies.html
- faq.html
- contact.html

🚫 Do NOT skip or drop ANY section.
🚫 Do NOT remove animations or effects.
🚫 Do NOT leave missing images or empty divs.
====================================================

====================================================
🔥 HOMEPAGE MUST MATCH 100% — NON-NEGOTIABLE
These MUST appear EXACTLY as in React:
- Full hero section with background hero image
- KPI badges (500+ UAE Businesses / Instant AED / 300% revenue boost)
- CTA buttons (Partner With Us / Watch Demo)
- Trust badges + card networks (Visa, Apple Pay, etc.)
- How It Works (Create → Pay → Settle)
- Industry grid with icons
- Why Choose SimpleBit (features + icons)
- Stats banner (10s payout / 300% growth / 99.9% uptime / $50M processed)
- Testimonials slider or cards
- Final CTA banner (gradient section)
If ANY of these are missing → DO NOT continue. FIX them.

====================================================
📌 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- JSX → HTML (className → class)
- Remove React imports, hooks, and routing
- Replace <Link> with <a href="page.html">
- Reproduce animations using AOS or CSS transitions
- Recreate interactivity with jQuery where needed

====================================================
📁 REQUIRED FINAL FOLDER STRUCTURE
/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── pricing.html
├── case-studies.html
├── faq.html
├── contact.html
└── assets/
    ├── css/style.css      (entire styling from React, no missing parts)
    ├── js/main.js         (jQuery version of interactions)
    └── images/            (EVERY image used in React MUST be placed here)

====================================================
📌 IMAGE + ASSET RULES
- Extract ALL images used in React, no exceptions
- The hero background image MUST be included — do NOT skip it
- If the path breaks, FIX IT, don’t delete it
- If any asset is unknown, create placeholders and list what is missing

====================================================
📌 INTERACTION + UI RULES
- Hover animations MUST work
- Scroll fade-in effects MUST work
- CTA states MUST match
- Card hover elevation MUST match
- FAQ accordion MUST function
- Buttons must look identical

====================================================
❗IF ANYTHING IS MISSING
- STOP immediately
- Ask which file is needed — DO NOT delete or skip
- DO NOT “approximate” or “simplify"

====================================================
🚀 START NOW:
Begin by converting ONLY the homepage (index.html) first — fully and with every section.
Show me the completed homepage BEFORE moving to other pages.
No missing elements. No placeholders. No gaps.
