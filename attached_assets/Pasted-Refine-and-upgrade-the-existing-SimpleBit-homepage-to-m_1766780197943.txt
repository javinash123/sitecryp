Refine and upgrade the existing SimpleBit homepage to make it look like a premium, world-class fintech product — similar to Stripe, Tap Payments, Zbooni, or Ziina. DO NOT rebuild from scratch; improve what already exists.

🔧 IMPROVE THE HERO SECTION
- Add proper top spacing so the headline doesn’t overlap the phone image.
- Increase readability: use a stronger gradient overlay at the bottom of the hero image.
- Keep the current text but optimize spacing, line height, and clarity.
- Add a feature strip under hero: 
  "✔ Apple Pay | ✔ Cards | ✔ Crypto | ✔ Instant AED Payouts | ✔ No Setup Fees"
- Keep Partner With Us as the PRIMARY CTA (filled button) 
- Make Watch Demo SECONDARY (outline button)
- On mobile: stack CTAs vertically, center align, reduce headline size slightly.

🎯 KPIs & TRUST BADGES (KEEP, BUT POLISH)
- Improve KPI line formatting: 
  “Trusted by 500+ UAE businesses  •  AED payouts in seconds  •  Up to 300% revenue boost”
- Add space so they don’t feel squeezed.
- Keep compliance badges but make them sharper and aligned: 
  PCI-DSS Level 1 • AES-256 Encryption • Instant AED Payouts

➡️ Add a subtle micro-animation on hover for KPI tags and compliance icons.

⚙️ HOW IT WORKS SECTION (FIX FLOW)
- Show all 3 steps side-by-side again, no missing cards.
- Create a left-to-right journey:
  "01 Create  →  02 Pay  →  03 Settle"
- Add a connecting arrow or dotted line to show progression.
- Add light hover elevation (shadow + slight scale).

🏪 INDUSTRY SECTION (ADD VALUE, NOT JUST ICONS)
Add one-line benefits under each industry icon:
- Restaurants: Table-side QR payments & instant tips
- Hotels: Secure check-in/out payment links
- Retail: Cardless checkout & digital invoices
- Salons: Deposits & bookings via WhatsApp pay links
- Gyms: Membership & subscription payments
- E-commerce: Zero gateway setup, link-based checkout

📌 Make icons interactive (hover scale + shadow).

⭐ TESTIMONIALS (MAKE THEM CREDIBLE)
- Keep 3 cards but align them evenly and add:
  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (star rating)
  “Verified Partner” badge under each reviewer
  Company label or logo placeholder under names

- Bold the metrics inside the testimonial to stand out:
  300% revenue boost • 10s checkout speed • 45% sales increase

📌 Add a tiny carousel indicator for polish or light auto-slide.

🛡️ SECURITY SECTION (MANDATORY FOR FINTECH)
Add a mini strip (can be before footer):
- PCI-DSS Compliant • AES-256 Encryption • Fraud Protection • UAE Compliant • Global Payment Networks

🎨 SPACING, ALIGNMENT, & VISUAL POLISH
- Increase section spacing for visual breathing room.
- Unify border radius across cards (10–14px)
- Add subtle shadows (not too heavy) and consistent hover states.
- Keep brand palette ONLY: #8e49f0, white, black — no extra colors.

📱 MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS FIXES
- Adjust font sizes for hero heading and KPI line.
- Stack CTAs vertically with margin.
- Make testimonial cards swipeable horizontally.
- Ensure no text overflow or cut-off lines.

💬 FINAL CTA UPGRADE (HIGH CONVERSION)
Replace current final CTA with:
“Start accepting payments today — onboard in under 24 hours.”
Buttons:
[ Book a Demo ]  (primary)
[ Chat on WhatsApp ] (secondary, green accent allowed ONLY for WhatsApp)
[ Explore Dashboard ] (ghost/outline)

❗DO NOT change branding or theme direction. 
This is a refinement pass, not a redesign.
Keep light mode only. Keep #8e49f0 as the brand anchor color.

🎯 GOAL:
When finished, the page should feel like a polished, premium fintech product:
- Clean spacing
- Strong CTAs
- Trust driven
- Fintech credibility
- Desktop + mobile optimized

Now apply all of the above changes directly to the current design.
